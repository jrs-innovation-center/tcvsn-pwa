# Veteran Support Base API

[Docs](../readme.md)

This RESTful HTTP API manages the representation of many resources
(organizations) filled with dedicated men and women committed to serving our
veterans and families. There can be no doubt that these people care a great deal
for our warriors. We are grateful for the sacrifices of our veterans and their
families. Now, please receive our gratitude and our desire to serve you with
that same spirit of excellence.

## Getting Started

Instructions on how to get a developer up and running on the Veteran Resource
Base API in a local, development environment.

> The instructions assume node >= 7x and you have access to a CouchDB
> installation on either your local machine or in the cloud as a DBaas, such as
> Cloudant.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jrs-innovation-center/tcvsn-pwa.git
$ cd tcvsn-pwa
```

## Create a database

Using either a local installation of MySQL or a DBaaS such as Amazon RDS, create
a new database. If your using a DBaaS, create an API key and/or ensure the key
as admin rights to the database. Admin rights are needed for creating indexes
within the database.

Using the principle of least privilege, you may wish to create a second API key
for your API. This key may only provide read, write access to the database.

> Tip: After creating your API Key or keys, you will need to write both the key
> and password down and keep it secure and safe. In the following step, you will
> use the key and password to create a `MYSQL_URI` as an environment variable and
> if you want to connect via ssl `MYSQL_SSL=Amazon RDS`

## API Environment Variables

### **.env**

* At the root of **api** folder, copy the **.env-sample** file as **.env** file.
  Modify the following environment variables. If you're using a DBaaS, use the
  key, password, and CouchDB base url to derive the value of `COUCHDB_URL`. If
  you aren't using a DBaaS and are running couchDB locally, just use the CouchDB
  base url. See example below. Use your newly created database name as the value
  of `COUCHDB_NAME`. Provide a `PORT` number, such as 4000, that does not
  conflict with other port numbers in your project.:

  * `MYSQL_URI`
  * `MYSQL_SSL`
  * `PORT`

For example, here are example values for `MYSQL_URI` and `MYSQL_SSL`
environment variables for an instance of CouchDB DBaaS running in IBM Blue Mix's
Cloudant service:

> Warning: Keep your API password/secret safe! Be sure your **.env** file is
> referenced within your **.gitignore**. Do not expose the secret in GitHub or
> anywhere else. If your secret is compromised, you will need to regenerate a
> new API key and secret and update your application.

```
MYSQL_URI=https://root:password@rds.aws.amazon.com:3306/tcvsn
MYSQL_SSL=Amazon RDS
```

### Installing Dependencies and starting our API

After you have successfully provided the values for your environment variables,
install dependencies, load data, load indexes, and start the api. See `scripts`
within the **package.json** for details:

**YARN EXAMPLE**

```bash
yarn
yarn load
yarn start
```

**NPM EXAMPLE**

```
npm install
npm run load
npm start
```

Check your terminal and verify the API starts. Attempt the following HTTP
requests using a client such as your browser or POSTman.

```
GET http://localhost:5000/resources
```

## Generating api-docs

```
yarn docs
yarn md-docs
```
